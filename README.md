# ModpackDownloader
A simple program for downloading mod packs from CurseForge using the manifest.json.

It exists because I don't want to download the CurseForge launcher only to download one mod pack.

# Usage

1.  Download the client mod pack files from the CurseForge website
2.  Extract the manifest.json file from the zip file
3.  Put the manifest.json and the ModpackDownloader.jar file into the mods folder of your Minecraft installation
4.  Either doubleclick the jar file or run it from the command line with:
    > java -jar ModpackDownloader.jar
5.  Enjoy while all required mods are being downloaded
